.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdfoutline

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpdfoutline\fP reads input file given as first argument, adds outlines from text file given
as second argument, and saves result to file with name given as third argument.
.P
File with outlines information should consist of lines in the following format:
.SAMPLE
\fI<level>\fP \fI<page>\fP Outline text
.ESAMPLE
.P
\fI<level>\fP and \fI<page>\fP should be integers.
Each field should be separated by exactly one space symbol.
All values for \fI<level>\fP should be greater or equal than that of the first line.
Page numeration starts with 1.
.P
Outlines file can contain comments that start with # in first column.
Comments and empty lines are ignored.
The text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding.
.SH OPTIONS
.B pdfoutline

.SH EXAMPLES
Here is example of outlines data file:
.SAMPLE
0 1 Document title
1 1 Chapter 1
2 1 Chapter 1.1
2 2 Chapter 1.2
1 3 Chapter 2
.ESAMPLE
.P
Using this file will result in outlines like the following:
.SAMPLE
Document title
+-Chapter 1
| +-Chapter 1.1
| +-Chapter 1.2
+-Chapter 2
.ESAMPLE
.SH BUGS
Due to a bug in Perl library \fBPDF::API2 v2.039\fP and earlier, some
Unicode characters are handled incorrectly and cause outline string
corruptions. For example, everything after the CJK character U+4E0A (ä¸Š)
will get corrupted in the PDF output because its UTF-16 encoding contains
byte 0x0A, which happens to be an ASCII newline character.
.P
For user convenience, this \fBpdfoutline\fP version includes a workaround
that should allow flawless operation down to \fBPDF::API2 v2.034\fP. Users
of even earlier versions should upgrade \fBPDF::API2\fP.
