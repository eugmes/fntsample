Building
--------

The following libraries are required to build ``fntsample``:
`cairo <https://www.cairographics.org>`_,
`fontconfig <https://www.fontconfig.org>`_,
`FreeType2 <https://www.freetype.org>`_,
`GLib <https://developer.gnome.org/glib/>`_,
`Pango <https://pango.gnome.org/>`_,
`gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`_.
They should be available in most Linux distributions.
Additionally Unicode `blocks <https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt>`_ file is required.

`CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ is used to build the code. In the directory with source code execute::

    % mkdir build
    % cd build
    % cmake .. -DUNICODE_BLOCKS=/path/to/Blocks.txt
    % make
    % make install

The last step will install files under ``/usr/local`` by default. This can be overridden by adding
``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/prefix`` to the ``cmake`` invocation.

``fntsample`` could be built using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ on macOS.
Use the following commands to install dependencies and configure the build
environment before building the code::

    % brew install cmake pgk-config gettext cairo pango fontconfig freetype glib
    % export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/gettext

Alternatively you can install ``fntsample`` using a Homebrew
`formula <https://github.com/eugmes/homebrew-fntsample>`_::

    % brew install eugmes/fntsample/fntsample
